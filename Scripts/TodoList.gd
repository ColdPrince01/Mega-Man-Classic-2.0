#To do list made for logging progress

#12/23/2023 
# - Added Finite State Machine for MegaMan
#

# Goals for next Session
# Add functionality for shooting while idle and shooting while running (either as state or built in to other states)
# Add hurt/stagger state
# Rework bullets 



#12/27/23
#Began making steps for new bullet scene, still deciding between doing state for shooting or perhaps handling it inside of another state 
# I need to understand the necessity of having a bullet behavior node, otherwise it might be better to just have all values necessary for 
# the bullet to be inside of the actual parent node
